## API
We use the [AirportDB](https://airportdb.io/) for getting the Airport location and the Airport name.
### How to connect the API?
- Go to the website of AirportDB and login and create an apiToken.
- Create an .env file in the repository and import your apiToken:
```
API_TOKEN=<your apiToken from AirportDB">
```

## What do you also need?
- **Google Chrome** for extracting the route data from flylat. Currently, there is no other way. In the future, there will be an API provided by Flylat.
